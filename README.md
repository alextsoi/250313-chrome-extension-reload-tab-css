# Idea:
- Using for 10years on a Chrome extension deprecated by Google
- Just 1 task: reload all the CSS under the current tab using a shortcut for development use

# Prompt:
Please create a google chrome extension for personal use to do below features only:
1. fn + F9 to reload the current tab all css

# Observation / Issue:
90% works, just the fn + F9 maybe not in current standard on Chrome Extension
When uploading to chrome, manifest.json returns some error but not syntax error

# Actions:
1. Changed to cmd + K instead of fn + F9

# Model
